<h2>Instant Film</h2>
<p>
    I heard someone say once that in photography “Shooting digital is the future, but shooting film keeps you honest.”
    Shooting instant film, is my attempt to stay honest, and constantly continue learning. There is something special
    that happens whenever you shoot instant film. It’s a piece of nostalgia that we can still participate with today.
    Shooting film has a sense of uncertainty to every photograph that you don’t get when shooting digital. You have to
    hope and pray that everything comes out well, and when it does, it’s invigorating. Whenever people see me shooting
    Polaroids, they’re often shocked that instant film is still available. We are indebted to those who have fought so
    hard to keep instant film alive. If we lose instant film, we will have lost a deeply personal and unique part of
    photography. That’s why I shoot instant film, because I want to be part of the movement of people who are creating
    tangible and meaningful photographs we can enjoy without a screen.
