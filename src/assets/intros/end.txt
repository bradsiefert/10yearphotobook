<h3>Thank Yous</h3>
<p>
    Iâ€™m indebted to the beautiful work created by my friends Eric, Anthony, Nathanael, Devin, Jason, Josh, Lawrence,
    and the many, many conversations with these friends and others that have inspired me and pushed me to be better.
    Thank you to Nicole, to Will, my parents, my New York friends, David Buth, and the community of photographers in
    Chicago that I happened to fall into. Special thanks to everyone I photographed in this book. It means the world
    to have photographs of you on hard drive.

    In making this book, I had to put aside thoughts of hubris and imposture syndrome at every step to make this
    happen. It would give me great joy if someone found this book and was inspired to create their own photobook or
    simply to create something at all. The whole world benefits when anyone perseveres to create what is on their
    heart. This is my attempt to do just that. Thank you for taking the time to read it.
